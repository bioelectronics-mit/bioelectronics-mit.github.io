She got her BS in Physics from St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University in 2003, and then spent a year as a researcher at the Los Alamos National Lab working on solar cells composed of semiconductor nanocrystals. She completed her PhD in Materials Science at MIT in 2009 with her thesis dedicated to physics-driven design of light-emitting devices based on organic materials and quantum dots. The curiosity towards biology led her to a postdoctoral fellowship in Neuroscience and Bioengineering at Stanford, where she began creating optoelectronic devices for recording and stimulation of neural activity. In 2011, Polina returned to MIT to start Bioelectronics group. The remarkable efforts of the group members have led to her tenure in 2017. In addition to the neural interface research, she is passionate about superheroes, and she uses their superpowers to help with teaching of undergraduate and graduate classes in the fields of electronics, photonics, and magnetism. Outside work, Polina is a committed distance runner and an enthusiastic rock climber.\n","date":1631750400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1631750400,"objectID":"d991bcb60da53fdf8931eb72e99041f1","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/author/polina-anikeeva/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/polina-anikeeva/","section":"authors","summary":"Polina was born in Leningrad, USSR but grew up in St. Petersburg, Russia.

In our group we explore magnetic nanomaterials as transducers of wireless magnetic neuromodulation (Science, 2015). Due to its negligible magnetic susceptibility and low conductivity, biological matter is nearly transparent to weak magnetic fields (MFs) in alternating the low radiofrequency range (10s of kHz to 10s of MHz). Furthermore, it is well known in the field of cancer hyperthermia that magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs, 5-30 nm in diameter) can dissipate significant heat via hysteretic power loss in MFs. We leveraged this local heating to trigger heat-sensitive ion channels genetically introduced (Science 2015) or naturally present in electroactive cells (Sci. Adv. 2020). To achieve efficient heat dissipation and thus rapid neuronal activation, we have synthesized a broad palette of tertiary magnetic oxides with coercivities varying across three orders of magnitude (ACS Nano 2013; Nano Lett. 2016) and developed a model for dynamic hysteresis in magnetic nanomaterials, which allowed us to tailor the conditions of alternating MF (Rev. Sci. Instr. 2017) to the MNP properties. The latter lead to the idea of magnetothermal multiplexing (Appl. Phys. Lett. 2014; Adv. Funct. Mater. 2020): the ability to independently heat (collocated) MNPs with different magnetic properties by using alternating MFs with distinct amplitudes and frequencies – a concept previously overlooked due to the use of linear models of hysteresis.\nIn addition to thermal stimulation of neural activity, we are leveraging hysteretic heat dissipation to enable local magnetically-driven delivery of pharmacological compounds to the membranes of neurons (Adv. Funct. Mater. 2016). This concept was further generalized by encapsulating MNPs within thermo-sensitive liposomes that releases their pharmacological payloads in response to the remotely applied MFs. Loaded with ligands for the natural or engineered receptors, these magneto-liposomes could mediate local chemomagnetic modulation of neuronal activity, enabling wireless control of mouse behavior in assays of sociability and motivation (Nat. Nanotechnol. 2019).\nFinally, we are exploring alternative means for using magnetic nanomaterials for neuromodulation, for example we are developing magnetic nanodiscs as transducers of mechanical stimuli under slow-varying MFs. Mechanical transduction mediated by magnetic nanomaterials demands either large MF gradients (~100 T/m) or particles with large magnetic moments. While the former is impractical in behaving subjects, the latter presents a challenge due to dipole-dipole interactions between single particle magnetic moments that render them colloidally unstable in solutions. We have addressed this challenge by developing anisotropic nanodiscs that in the absence of magnetic fields support a magnetic vortex state with zero net magnetization ensuring their colloidal stability. Upon application of weak, slow varying MFs, these particles assume in-plane magnetization and transduce torques to the cell membranes proportional to their magnetic volumes (ACS Nano 2020).\n","date":160056e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":160056e4,"objectID":"e37331b6d6c17d267ed8a7f37f16834d","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/research-topic/1.magnetic-transducers/","publishdate":"2020-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research-topic/1.magnetic-transducers/","section":"research-topic","summary":"Minimally invasive neural stimulation","tags":["Nanotransducers"],"title":"Magnetic Nanotransducers","type":"research-topic"},{"authors":["Polina Anikeeva"],"categories":null,"content":"Currently available interface technologies for mapping of neural circuits suffer from fundamental limitations of low resolution, inability to perform multiple functions (recording, stimulation, drug delivery, chemical sensing etc.) simultaneously, and limited application space (i.e. cortex). Furthermore, the difference between the elastic and chemical properties of the neural tissues and the implanted probes results in a profound foreign body response and the formation of glial scars that isolate the devices from healthy tissue resulting in a loss of useful signal. By employing flexible and biocompatible neural probes we intend to address both the mechanical and chemical issues of neural recording devices. Furthermore, using simultaneous processing of multiple materials we can incorporate capabilities inaccessible to existing lithographically defined devices, such as simultaneous optical or pharmacological stimulation combine with high-resolution neural recording.\nBy leveraging recent advances in multi-material fiber-drawing processing traditionally used in telecommunications industry as well as photonics research, we combine polymers, metals and conductive composites to produce flexible probes incorporating conductive electrodes, optical waveguides and microfluidic channels (Nat. Biotechnol. 2015; Nat. Neurosci. 2017). These multifunctional fiber-based probes with features as small as 5 µm allow, for the first time, for concomitant neural recording, optogenetic stimulation and drug delivery in the brain of freely moving mice, a set of capabilities indispensable in systems neuroscience, a field that aims to connect the dynamics of neural circuits to the observed behaviors. We are also working towards extending our fiber-probe technology to the applications in the peripheral nervous system and the spinal cord, which demand high flexibility and extremely low dimensions. Specifically, we were the first lab to demonstrate simultaneous neural recording and optogenetic stimulation in a mouse spinal cord that enabled direct optical control of lower limb muscles (Adv. Funct. Mater. 2014; Sci. Adv. 2017). Most recently, we have extended our flexible fiber-based tools to manipulation and monitoring of the circuits in the enteric (gut) nervous system (bioRxiv 2020), paving way to understanding the communication between the gut and the brain and to developing early diagnostics and treatments for conditions ranging from obesity to Parkinson’s disease.\nTo advance the studies of chemical neurotransmission, we are combining fiber-based tools with principles of photopharmacology and electrochemistry to achieve spatiotemporally precise generation of neuro-active compounds within specific regions of the nervous system. For instance, photoswitchable compounds have been instrumental in studies of receptors in neurons, but their potential in linking receptor function to behavior was not realized due to lack of tools for simultaneous light and drug delivery in moving subjects. To facilitate applications of photopharmacology in systems neuroscience, we have demonstrated control of reward behaviors in mice using miniature polymer fibers integrating waveguides and microfluidics (bioRxiv 2020). Gaseous neurochemicals such as a secondary messenger nitric oxide (NO) present a greater challenge to delivery into the brain. Inspired by catalysis of a metabolite nitrite into NO by enzymes containing iron-sulfur clusters in their cores, we have designed electrocatalytic fibers comprising cathodes decorated with platinum doped Fe3S4 nanoclusters and platinum anodes in addition to microfluidic channels. The Fe3S4-Pt nanoclusters within the electrocatalytic fibers were able to catalyze the generation of NO from the sodium nitrite solutions delivered via the same devices. We have applied these fibers to locally generate NO and control NO-mediated neural signaling in vitro and in vivo, paving way for studies of the role of this gaseous messenger in synaptic plasticity and metabolism (Nat. Nanotechnol. 2020).\n","date":160056e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":160056e4,"objectID":"d17748f3e5999fd64103b3114b2be335","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/research-topic/2.multifunctional-fibers/","publishdate":"2020-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research-topic/2.multifunctional-fibers/","section":"research-topic","summary":"Recording and manipulation of neural activity","tags":["Multifunctional Fibers"],"title":"Multifunctional Fibers","type":"research-topic"},{"authors":["Polina Anikeeva"],"categories":null,"content":"In addition to neural interrogation, we are interested in using fiber-based all-polymer devices as scaffolds for neural tissue engineering and as potential replacements to the injured organs. The versatility of the fiber drawing process allows us to investigate the surface polarity and topographic structure of polymer-based nerve guidance channels on the axonal growth. Furthermore, we can design the fiber-based scaffolds to incorporate neural recording and optical neuromodulation capabilities. The latter may enable us to investigate the role of neural excitation on the axonal growth within the topographically controlled environment. We have recently found that optical neural excitation increases axonal growth by 3-4 fold, and furthermore exerts a directional bias on the growth of unstimulated tissues (Sci. Rep. 2015). By combining this finding with the ability to optimize the scaffold geometry (Biomaterials 2016) and nutrient transport (Adv. Mater. 2019) we intend to control the formation of synaptic connections between the neurons trapped within our scaffolds and the neurons within the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerves.\nWith the goal of developing seamless interfaces between the prosthetic limbs and the injured nerves, we applied fiber fabrication to create light-weight fiber-based artificial muscles (Science 2019).

We image the spatial current profile within three-dimensional tungsten ditelluride and find that it exhibits non-uniform current density, indicating hydrodynamic flow. Our temperature-resolved current profile measurements reveal a non-monotonic temperature dependence, with the strongest hydrodynamic effects at approximately 20{\thinspace}K. We also report ab initio calculations showing that electron--electron interactions are not explained by the Coulomb interaction alone, but are predominantly mediated by phonons.

Here we present the general transport signatures of such a second-order scattering mechanism, along with analytical limits at the Eliashberg level of theory. We study electronic transport, using ab initio calculations, in finite-size channels of semimetallic ZrSiS and TaAs2 with and without topological band crossings, respectively. The order of magnitude separation between momentum-relaxing and momentum-conserving scattering length-scales across a wide temperature range make both of them promising candidates for further experimental observation of electron hydrodynamics. More generally, our calculations show that the hydrodynamic transport regime can be realized in a much broader class of anisotropic metals and does not, to first order, rely on the topological nature of the bands. Finally, we discuss general design principles guiding future search for hydrodynamic candidates, based on the analytical formulation and our ab initio predictions. We find that systems with strong electron-phonon interactions, reduced electronic phase space, and suppressed phonon-phonon scattering at temperatures of interest are likely to feature hydrodynamic electron transport.

Here, we explore the potential of polymer fibers comprising six graphite-doped electrodes and two microfluidic channels within a flexible polycarbonate body as a platform for sensing pH and neurometabolic lactate. Electrodes were made into potentiometric sensors (responsive to pH) or amperometric sensors (lactate biosensors). The growth of an iridium oxide layer made the fiber electrodes responsive to pH in a physiologically relevant range. Lactate biosensors were fabricated via platinum black growth on the fiber electrode, followed by an enzyme layer, making them responsive to lactate concentration. Lactate fiber biosensors detected transient neurometabolic lactate changes in an in vivo mouse model. Lactate concentration changes were associated with spreading depolarizations, known to be detrimental to the injured brain. Induced waves were identified by a signature lactate concentration change profile and measured as having a speed of ∼2.7 mm/min (n = 4 waves). Our work highlights the potential applications of fiber-based biosensors for direct monitoring of brain metabolites in the context of injury.","tags":null,"title":"Fiber-Based Electrochemical Biosensors for Monitoring pH and Transient Neurometabolic Lactate","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kate Reidy","Georgios Varnavides","Joachim Dahl Thomsen","Abinash Kumar","Thang Pham","Arthur M Blackburn","Polina Anikeeva","Prineha Narang","James M LeBeau","Frances M Ross"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614297600,"objectID":"489d26310074140286810540a5663a2e","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/varnavides-2021-direct/","publishdate":"2021-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/varnavides-2021-direct/","section":"publication","summary":"The atomic structure at the interface between two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) materials influences properties such as contact resistance, photo-response, and high-frequency electrical performance.

Such preference depends on the sugar entering the intestine.1–4 Although the brain is aware of the stimulus within seconds,5–8 how the gut discerns the caloric sugar to guide choice is unknown. Recently, we discovered an intestinal transducer, known as the neuropod cell.9,10 This cell synapses with the vagus to inform the brain about glucose in the gut in milliseconds.10 Here, we demonstrate that neuropod cells distinguish a caloric sugar from a non-caloric sweetener using the electrogenic sodium glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT1) or sweet taste receptors. Activation of neuropod cells by non-caloric sucralose leads to ATP release, whereas the entry of caloric sucrose via SGLT1 stimulates glutamate release. To interrogate the contribution of the neuropod cell to sugar preference, we developed a method to record animal preferences in real time while using optogenetics to silence or excite neuropod cells. We discovered that silencing these cells, or blocking their glutamatergic signaling, renders the animals unable to recognize the caloric sugar. And, exciting neuropod cells leads the animal to consume the non-caloric sweetener as if it were caloric. By transducing the precise identity of the stimuli entering the gut, neuropod cells guide an animal’s internal preference toward the caloric sugar.","tags":null,"title":"A gut sensor for sugar preference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuanyuan Guo","Carl F Werner","Andres Canales","Li Yu","Xiaoting Jia","Polina Anikeeva","Tatsuo Yoshinobu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579824e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579824e3,"objectID":"c5b763a06fea44dd01c3396a2da97044","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/guo-2020-polymer/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T15:25:55.35907Z","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-2020-polymer/","section":"publication","summary":"Electrical recording permits direct readout of neural activity but offers limited ability to correlate it to the network topography.

Engineered receptors exclusively activated by designer small molecules enable manipulation of specific neural pathways. However, their application to studies of behaviour has thus far been hampered by a trade-off between the low temporal resolution of systemic injection versus the invasiveness of implanted cannulae or infusion pumps. Here, we developed a remotely controlled chemomagnetic modulation—a nanomaterials-based technique that permits the pharmacological interrogation of targeted neural populations in freely moving subjects. The heat dissipated by magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in the presence of alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) triggers small-molecule release from thermally sensitive lipid vesicles with a 20 s latency. Coupled with the chemogenetic activation of engineered receptors, this technique permits the control of specific neurons with temporal and spatial precision. The delivery of chemomagnetic particles to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) allows the remote modulation of motivated behaviour in mice. Furthermore, this chemomagnetic approach activates endogenous circuits by enabling the regulated release of receptor ligands. Applied to an endogenous dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) agonist in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain area involved in mediating social interactions, chemomagnetic modulation increases sociability in mice. By offering a temporally precise control of specified ligand–receptor interactions in neurons, this approach may facilitate molecular neuroscience studies in behaving organisms.","tags":null,"title":"Remotely controlled chemomagnetic modulation of targeted neural circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["James A Frank","Marc-Joseph Antonini","Polina Anikeeva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565568e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565568e3,"objectID":"cb79f55db31d0193f33fde526bc3b13d","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/frank-2019-next/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T15:25:55.358632Z","relpermalink":"/publication/frank-2019-next/","section":"publication","summary":"Monitoring and modulating the diversity of signals used by neurons and glia in a closed-loop fashion is necessary to establish causative links between biochemical processes within the nervous system and observed behaviors.

In this review, we will provide background information on the different techniques of neuromodulation discussing their latest refinements and future potentials including the implementation of nanoparticles (NPs).

Optogenetic modulation of neural activity is a ubiquitous tool for basic investigation of brain circuits. While the majority of optogenetic paradigms rely on short light pulses to evoke synchronized activity of optically sensitized cells, many neurobiological processes are associated with slow local field potential (LFP) oscillations. Therefore, we developed a hybrid fiber probe capable of simultaneous electrophysiological recording and optical stimulation and used it to investigate the utility of sinusoidal light stimulation for evoking oscillatory neural activity in vivo across a broad frequency range. Approach. We fabricated hybrid fiber probes comprising a hollow cylindrical array of 9 electrodes and a flexible optical waveguide integrated within the core. We implanted these probes in the hippocampus of transgenic Thy1-ChR2-YFP mice that broadly express the blue-light sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) in excitatory neurons across the brain. The effects of the sinusoidal light stimulation were characterized and contrasted with those corresponding to pulsed stimulation in the frequency range of physiological LFP rhythms (3–128 Hz). Main results. Within hybrid probes, metal electrode surfaces were vertically aligned with the waveguide tip, which minimized optical stimulation artifacts in neurophysiological recordings. Sinusoidal stimulation resulted in reliable and coherent entrainment of LFP oscillations up to 70 Hz, the cutoff frequency of ChR2, with response amplitudes inversely scaling with the stimulation frequencies. Effectiveness of the stimulation was maintained for two months following implantation. Significance. Alternative stimulation patterns complementing existing pulsed protocols, in particular sinusoidal light stimulation, are a prerequisite for investigating the physiological mechanisms underlying brain rhythms. So far, studies applying sinusoidal stimulation in vivo were limited to single stimulation frequencies. We show the feasibility of sinusoidal stimulation in vivo to induce coherent LFP oscillations across the entire frequency spectrum supported by the gating dynamics of ChR2 and introduce a hybrid fiber probe tailored to continuous light stimulation.","tags":null,"title":"Optogenetic entrainment of neural oscillations with hybrid fiber probes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seongjun Park","James A Frank","Polina Anikeeva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1528675200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1528675200,"objectID":"3adbb1a5b06b074062aeac9280cb290f","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/park-2018-silicon/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T15:25:55.357634Z","relpermalink":"/publication/park-2018-silicon/","section":"publication","summary":"Design principles for the development of silicon biointerfaces enable the non-genetic, light-controlled modulation of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, and of cellular excitability in vitro, in tissue slices and in mouse brains.","tags":null,"title":"Silicon biointerfaces for all scales","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Polina Anikeeva","Charles M Lieber","Jinwoo Cheon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1526342400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526342400,"objectID":"45bf4b925d3fb5a1c4238c657fc95933","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/anikeeva-2018-creating/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T15:25:55.357353Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anikeeva-2018-creating/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Creating Functional Interfaces with Biological Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Polina Anikeeva","Liqun Luo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525910400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525910400,"objectID":"d12ddfe00f80ca9edb5847fe0f736a85","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/anikeeva-2018-editorial/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T15:25:55.357221Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anikeeva-2018-editorial/","section":"publication","summary":"In this issue of CONB we highlight recent developments in tools to interrogate neuronal function across species ranging from fruit flies to humans, spatial scales spanning individual synapses to entire brains, and temporal resolution from milliseconds to months.","tags":null,"title":"Editorial overview: Neurotechnologies.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tirin Moore","Cynthia Chestek","Daniel Polley","Alon Chen","Simon Hippenmeyer","Polina Anikeeva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525219200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525219200,"objectID":"ddbdff8302a0615888ec5fe2636b0431","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/moore-2018-visions/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T15:25:55.358214Z","relpermalink":"/publication/moore-2018-visions/","section":"publication","summary":"Neuroscience is a broad discipline that embraces technology at multiple scales to understand the brain and to develop potential therapies.

Motivated by the hypothesis that reducing the mechanical stiffness of implanted probes may improve their long-term reliability, a variety of probes based on soft materials have been developed.\nIn addition to enabling electrical neural recording, these probes have been engineered to take advantage of genetic tools for optical neuromodulation. With the emergence of optogenetics, it became possible to optically excite or inhibit genetically identifiable cell types via expression of light-sensitive opsins. Optogenetics experiments often demand implantable multifunctional devices to optically stimulate, deliver viral vectors and drugs, and simultaneously record electrophysiological signals from the specified cells within the nervous system. Recent advances in microcontact printing and microfabrication techniques have equipped flexible probes with microscale light-emitting diodes (μLEDs), waveguides, and microfluidic channels.\nComplementary to these approaches, fiber drawing has emerged as a scalable route to integration of multiple functional features within miniature and flexible neural probes. The thermal drawing process relies on the fabrication of macroscale models containing the materials of interest, which are then drawn into microstructured fibers with predefined cross-sectional geometries. We have recently applied this approach to produce fibers integrating conductive electrodes for extracellular recording of single- and multineuron potentials, low-loss optical waveguides for optogenetic neuromodulation, and microfluidic channels for drug and viral vector delivery. These devices allowed dynamic investigation of the time course of opsin expression across multiple brain regions and enabled pairing of optical stimulation with local pharmacological intervention in behaving animals.\nNeural probes designed to interface with the spinal cord, a viscoelastic tissue undergoing repeated strain during normal movement, rely on the integration of soft and flexible materials to avoid injury and device failure. Employing soft substrates, such as parylene C and poly-(dimethylsiloxane), for electrode and μLED arrays permitted stimulation and recording of neural activity on the surface of the spinal cord. Similarly, thermally drawn flexible and stretchable optoelectronic fibers that resemble the fibrous structure of the spinal cord were implanted without any significant inflammatory reaction in the vicinity of the probes. These fibers enabled simultaneous recording and optogenetic stimulation of neural activity in the spinal cord.\nIn this Account, we review the applications of multifunctional fibers and other integrated devices for optoelectronic probing of neural circuits and discuss engineering directions that may facilitate future studies of nerve repair and accelerate the development of bioelectronic medical devices.","tags":null,"title":"Multifunctional fibers as tools for neuroscience and neuroengineering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bozhi Tian","Shuai Xu","John A Rogers","Stefano Cestellos-Blanco","Peidong Yang","João L Carvalho-de-Souza","Francisco Bezanilla","Jia Liu","Zhenan Bao","Martin Hjort","Yuhong Cao","Nicholas Melosh","Guglielmo Lanzani","Fabio Benfenati","Giulia Galli","Francois Gygi","Rylan Kautz","Alon A Gorodetsky","Samuel S Kim","Timothy K Lu","Polina Anikeeva","Michal Cifra","Ondrej Krivosudsky","Daniel Havelka","Yuanwen Jiang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1520553600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1520553600,"objectID":"1a772809025a1607e86dba8634f3fa0c","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/tian-2018-roadmap/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T15:25:55.356769Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tian-2018-roadmap/","section":"publication","summary":"This roadmap outlines the role semiconductor-based materials play in understanding the complex biophysical dynamics at multiple length scales, as well as the design and implementation of next-generation electronic, optoelectronic, and mechanical devices for biointerfaces.

Unfortunately, the challenges and costs of developing experimental setups commonly used to produce AMFs with suitable field amplitudes and frequencies present a barrier to researchers. This paper first presents a simple, cost-effective, and robust alternative for small AMF working volumes that uses soft ferromagnetic cores to focus the flux into a gap. As the experimental length scale increases to accommodate animal models (working volumes of 100s of cm3 or greater), poor thermal conductivity and volumetrically scaled core losses render that strategy ineffective. Comparatively feasible strategies for these larger volumes instead use low loss resonant tank circuits to generate circulating currents of 1 kA or greater in order to produce the comparable field amplitudes. These principles can be extended to the problem of identifying practical routes for scaling AMF setups to humans, an infrequently acknowledged challenge that influences the extent to which many applications of MNPs may ever become clinically relevant.","tags":null,"title":"Practical methods for generating alternating magnetic fields for biomedical research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chi Lu","Seongjun Park","Thomas J Richner","Alexander Derry","Imogen Brown","Chong Hou","Siyuan Rao","Jeewoo Kang","Chet T Moritz","Yoel Fink","Polina Anikeeva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1490745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490745600,"objectID":"4632df45ad59d3292b95c53fbb0d9b3b","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/lu-2017-flexible/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T15:25:55.356444Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lu-2017-flexible/","section":"publication","summary":"Studies of neural pathways that contribute to loss and recovery of function following paralyzing spinal cord injury require devices for modulating and recording electrophysiological activity in specific neurons.

Although orders of magnitude smaller and computationally faster than neurons, conventional substrate-bound electronics do not recapitulate the chemical and mechanical properties of neural tissue. This mismatch results in a foreign-body response and the encapsulation of devices by glial scars, suggesting that the design of an interface between the nervous system and a synthetic sensor requires additional materials innovation.

Therefore, new diagnostic tools that capture the molecular activity at the disease site in vivo are needed to better understand tumor behavior and ultimately maximize therapeutic responses. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) drive multiple aspects of tumorigenesis, and their activity can be monitored using engineered peptide substrates as protease-specific probes. To identify tumor specific activity profiles, local sampling of the tumor microenvironment is necessary, such as through remote control of probes, which are only activated at the tumor site. Alternating magnetic fields (AMFs) provide an attractive option to remotely apply local triggering signals because they penetrate deep into the body and are not likely to interfere with biological processes due to the weak magnetic properties of tissue. Here, we report the design and evaluation of a protease-activity nanosensor that can be remotely activated at the site of disease via an AMF at 515 kHz and 15 kA/m. Our nanosensor was composed of thermosensitive liposomes containing functionalized protease substrates that were unveiled at the target site by remotely triggered heat dissipation of coencapsulated magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). This nanosensor was combined with a unique detection assay to quantify the amount of cleaved substrates in the urine.

In addition, our method allows us to fabricate both monochrome and red−green−blue patterned electroluminescent structures with 25 μm critical dimension, corresponding to 1000 ppi (pixels-per-inch) print resolution.","tags":null,"title":"Contact printing of quantum dot light-emitting devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Polina Anikeeva","CF Madigan","Jonathan Eugene Halpert","MG Bawendi","V Bulović"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1219795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1219795200,"objectID":"4f58120947fed00b495bbd106ef867d3","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/anikeeva-2008-electronic/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T15:25:55.350744Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anikeeva-2008-electronic/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigate the mechanism of operation of hybrid organic/colloidal quantum dot light emitting devices (QD-LEDs). Novel quantum dot (QD) deposition methods allow us to change the location of an emissive QD monolayer within a QD-LED multilayer structure. We find that the quantum efficiency of devices improves by \u003e50% upon imbedding QD monolayers into the hole transporting layer \u003c10nm away from the interface between hole and electron transporting layers. We consider two possible mechanisms responsible for this improvement: one based on a charge injection model of the device operation and the other based on an exciton energy-transfer model. In order to differentiate between the two suggested mechanisms, we fabricate a set of structures that enable control over charge injection into colloidal QDs. We find that the dominant process limiting QD-LED efficiency is charging of the QDs by trapped electrons. We demonstrate that with the set of organic materials implemented in this study, device efficiency is increased by maximizing energy transfer from organics to QDs and by limiting direct charge injection that contributes to QD charging.","tags":null,"title":"Electronic and excitonic processes in light-emitting devices based on organic materials and colloidal quantum dots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Polina Anikeeva","Jonathan E Halpert","Moungi G Bawendi","Vladimir Bulović"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1183852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1183852800,"objectID":"e01c6ed5ee1c957c0d1a3a56bebf6c4c","permalink":"https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/publication/anikeeva-2007-electroluminescence/","publishdate":"2020-06-14T15:25:55.349503Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anikeeva-2007-electroluminescence/","section":"publication","summary":"We demonstrate light emitting devices (LEDs) with a broad spectral emission generated by electroluminescence from a mixed-monolayer of red, green, and blue emitting colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in a hybrid organic/inorganic structure.

Independent processing of the organic charge transport layers and the QD luminescent layer allows for precise tuning of the emission spectrum without changing the device structure, simply by changing the ratio of different color QDs in the active layer.

The technological potential of NCs as lasing materials is, however, significantly diminished by highly efficient nonradiative Auger recombination of multiexcitons leading to ultrafast decay of optical gain. Here we explore a novel approach to achieve NC lasing in the Auger-recombination-free regime by using type II NC heterostructures that promote spatial separation of electrons and holes. We show that such hetero-NCs can exhibit strong repulsive excitonexciton interactions that lead to significantly reduced excited-state absorption associated with NCs containing single electron-hole pairs. This effect leads to reduced optical-gain thresholds and can potentially allow lasing in the single-exciton regime, for which Auger recombination is inactive. We use these novel heteroNCs to demonstrate efficient amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) that is tunable across a “difficult” range of green and blue colors. The ASE in the blue range has never been previously achieved using traditional NCs with type I carrier localization.","tags":null,"title":"Light amplification using inverted core/shell nanocrystals: towards lasing in the single-exciton regime","type":"publication"}]
