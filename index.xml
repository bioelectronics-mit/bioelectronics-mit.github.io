By delivering magnetic nanomaterials into biological systems we enable manipulation of a variety of physiological processes with weak magnetic fields. Through a combination of magnetic nanomaterials synthesis and characterization, we create a diversity of magnetic nanotransducers capable of selectively converting distinct magnetic fields into specific signals perceived by receptors in neurons. To date, we have developed nanotransducers that undergo heating (&lt;a href="../../publication/chen-2015-wireless/">Science 2015&lt;/a>) in rapidly alternating magnetic fields to trigger heat-sensitive ion channels as well as nanotransducers that exert a physical torque (&lt;a href="../../publication/gregurec-2019-tuning/">ACS Nano 2019&lt;/a>) stimulating mechanosensitive ion channels. By coupling heating to thermosensitive reactions, we have demonstrated nanotransducers that can deliver ions (&lt;a href="../../publication/park-2020-remotely/">Nano Lett. 2020&lt;/a>) and pharmacological compounds (&lt;a href="../../publication/rao-2019-remotely/">Nat. Nanotechnol. 2019&lt;/a>) to target chemoreceptors. We have applied our nanotransducers to wirelessly and minimally-invasively manipulate neuronal activity, hormonal release (&lt;a href="../../publication/rosenfeld-2020-transgene/">Sci. Adv. 2020&lt;/a>), and behavior (&lt;a href="../../publication/hescham-2021-thermal-parkinsonian/">Nat. Comm. 2021&lt;/a>) under physiological and pathological conditions. Our current work continues to explore fundamental properties of magnetic nanomaterials with the goal of expanding the array of available magnetic modalities for neuromodulation. We are additionally interested in delivery and visualization of our materials within specific organs and specific cell types.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Magnetic Nanotransducers</title><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/old_research/1.magnetic-transducers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/old_research/1.magnetic-transducers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Neuromodulation approaches available to the neuroscience community are either mechanically invasive (electrical stimulation), require transgenes (e.g. optogenetics, DREADDs), or lacking the resolution and cell-type specificity (ultrasound, transcranial magnetic stimulation). In our group we explore magnetic nanomaterials as transducers of wireless magnetic neuromodulation (&lt;a href="../../publication/chen-2015-wireless/">Science, 2015&lt;/a>). Due to its negligible magnetic susceptibility and low conductivity, biological matter is nearly transparent to weak magnetic fields (MFs) in alternating the low radiofrequency range (10s of kHz to 10s of MHz). Furthermore, it is well known in the field of cancer hyperthermia that magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs, 5-30 nm in diameter) can dissipate significant heat via hysteretic power loss in MFs. We leveraged this local heating to trigger heat-sensitive ion channels genetically introduced (&lt;a href="../../publication/chen-2015-wireless/">Science 2015&lt;/a>) or naturally present in electroactive cells (&lt;a href="../../publication/rosenfeld-2020-transgene/">Sci. Adv. 2020&lt;/a>). To achieve efficient heat dissipation and thus rapid neuronal activation, we have synthesized a broad palette of tertiary magnetic oxides with coercivities varying across three orders of magnitude (&lt;a href="../../publication/chen-2013-maximizing/">ACS Nano 2013&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="../../publication/chen-2016-high/">Nano Lett. 2016&lt;/a>) and developed a model for dynamic hysteresis in magnetic nanomaterials, which allowed us to tailor the conditions of alternating MF (&lt;a href="../../publication/christiansen-2017-practical/">Rev. Sci. Instr. 2017&lt;/a>) to the MNP properties. The latter lead to the idea of magnetothermal multiplexing (&lt;a href="publication/christiansen-2014-magnetically/">Appl. Phys. Lett. 2014&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="publication/moon-2020-magneothermal/">Adv. Funct. Mater. 2020&lt;/a>): the ability to independently heat (collocated) MNPs with different magnetic properties by using alternating MFs with distinct amplitudes and frequencies – a concept previously overlooked due to the use of linear models of hysteresis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to thermal stimulation of neural activity, we are leveraging hysteretic heat dissipation to enable local magnetically-driven delivery of pharmacological compounds to the membranes of neurons (&lt;a href="../../publication/romero-2016-localized/">Adv. Funct. Mater. 2016&lt;/a>). This concept was further generalized by encapsulating MNPs within thermo-sensitive liposomes that releases their pharmacological payloads in response to the remotely applied MFs. Loaded with ligands for the natural or engineered receptors, these magneto-liposomes could mediate local chemomagnetic modulation of neuronal activity, enabling wireless control of mouse behavior in assays of sociability and motivation (&lt;a href="../../publication/rao-2019-remotely/">Nat. Nanotechnol. 2019&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we are exploring alternative means for using magnetic nanomaterials for neuromodulation, for example we are developing magnetic nanodiscs as transducers of mechanical stimuli under slow-varying MFs. Mechanical transduction mediated by magnetic nanomaterials demands either large MF gradients (~100 T/m) or particles with large magnetic moments. While the former is impractical in behaving subjects, the latter presents a challenge due to dipole-dipole interactions between single particle magnetic moments that render them colloidally unstable in solutions. We have addressed this challenge by developing anisotropic nanodiscs that in the absence of magnetic fields support a magnetic vortex state with zero net magnetization ensuring their colloidal stability. Upon application of weak, slow varying MFs, these particles assume in-plane magnetization and transduce torques to the cell membranes proportional to their magnetic volumes (&lt;a href="../../publication/gregurec-2019-tuning/">ACS Nano 2020&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/people_sub/10_landing-page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/people_sub/10_landing-page/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Area II: Multifunctional interfaces with central and peripheral nervous systems</title><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/research/2.multifunctional-fibers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/research/2.multifunctional-fibers/</guid><description>&lt;p>To understand the signaling complexity in neural circuits, while matching the mechanical and chemical properties of tissues and organs, we design miniature, soft, and flexible multifunctional devices capable of electrical, optical, and chemical interrogation of neuronal activity. Devices capable of interfacing with organs as diverse as the brain, spinal cord, and the gastrointestinal tract, demand versatility in materials, designs, and fabrication approaches to adapt to the target organ anatomy and physiology. We combine scalable fiber drawing with additive/subtractive manufacturing and traditional lithographic techniques to seamlessly integrate polymers, metals, composites, and solid-state microelectronics into multifunctional probes with microscale features. Our fiber-based probes have enabled optogenetics, electrophysiology, and drug and gene delivery in the brain (&lt;a href="../../publication/canales-2015-multifunctional/">Nat. Biotech.&lt;/a>) and spinal cord (&lt;a href="../../publication/lu-2017-flexible/">Sci. Adv.&lt;/a>) of behaving rodents (&lt;a href="../../publication/park-2017-one/">Nat. Neurosci.&lt;/a>) and have recently permitted multifunctional interrogation of neuronal signaling (&lt;a href="../../publication/garwood-2022-multifunctional/">BioRxiv&lt;/a>) in non-human primates performing complex tasks. More recently, we have created wireless probes that enabled optical neuromodulation and physiological recordings across gut and the brain, allowing for long-term studies of gut-brain circuits in behaving subjects (&lt;a href="../../publication/shahriari-2023-multifunctional/">Nat. Biotech.&lt;/a>). Our current work seeks to expand the palette of functional features in diverse device architectures to advance the basic understanding of brain-body neural circuits as well as develop bioelectronic therapies for neurobiological disorders.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multifunctional Fibers</title><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/old_research/2.multifunctional-fibers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/old_research/2.multifunctional-fibers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Currently available interface technologies for mapping of neural circuits suffer from fundamental limitations of low resolution, inability to perform multiple functions (recording, stimulation, drug delivery, chemical sensing etc.) simultaneously, and limited application space (i.e. cortex). Furthermore, the difference between the elastic and chemical properties of the neural tissues and the implanted probes results in a profound foreign body response and the formation of glial scars that isolate the devices from healthy tissue resulting in a loss of useful signal. By employing flexible and biocompatible neural probes we intend to address both the mechanical and chemical issues of neural recording devices. Furthermore, using simultaneous processing of multiple materials we can incorporate capabilities inaccessible to existing lithographically defined devices, such as simultaneous optical or pharmacological stimulation combine with high-resolution neural recording.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By leveraging recent advances in multi-material fiber-drawing processing traditionally used in telecommunications industry as well as photonics research, we combine polymers, metals and conductive composites to produce flexible probes incorporating conductive electrodes, optical waveguides and microfluidic channels (&lt;a href="../../publication/canales-2015-multifunctional/">Nat. Biotechnol. 2015&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="../../publication/park-2017-one/">Nat. Neurosci. 2017&lt;/a>). These multifunctional fiber-based probes with features as small as 5 µm allow, for the first time, for concomitant neural recording, optogenetic stimulation and drug delivery in the brain of freely moving mice, a set of capabilities indispensable in systems neuroscience, a field that aims to connect the dynamics of neural circuits to the observed behaviors. We are also working towards extending our fiber-probe technology to the applications in the peripheral nervous system and the spinal cord, which demand high flexibility and extremely low dimensions. Specifically, we were the first lab to demonstrate simultaneous neural recording and optogenetic stimulation in a mouse spinal cord that enabled direct optical control of lower limb muscles (&lt;a href="../../publication/lu-2014-polymer/">Adv. Funct. Mater. 2014&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="../../publication/lu-2017-flexible/">Sci. Adv. 2017&lt;/a>). Most recently, we have extended our flexible fiber-based tools to manipulation and monitoring of the circuits in the enteric (gut) nervous system (&lt;a href="../../publication/frank-2020-vivo/">bioRxiv 2020&lt;/a>), paving way to understanding the communication between the gut and the brain and to developing early diagnostics and treatments for conditions ranging from obesity to Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To advance the studies of chemical neurotransmission, we are combining fiber-based tools with principles of photopharmacology and electrochemistry to achieve spatiotemporally precise generation of neuro-active compounds within specific regions of the nervous system. For instance, photoswitchable compounds have been instrumental in studies of receptors in neurons, but their potential in linking receptor function to behavior was not realized due to lack of tools for simultaneous light and drug delivery in moving subjects. To facilitate applications of photopharmacology in systems neuroscience, we have demonstrated control of reward behaviors in mice using miniature polymer fibers integrating waveguides and microfluidics (&lt;a href="../../publication/frank-2020-vivo/">bioRxiv 2020&lt;/a>). Gaseous neurochemicals such as a secondary messenger nitric oxide (NO) present a greater challenge to delivery into the brain. Inspired by catalysis of a metabolite nitrite into NO by enzymes containing iron-sulfur clusters in their cores, we have designed electrocatalytic fibers comprising cathodes decorated with platinum doped Fe3S4 nanoclusters and platinum anodes in addition to microfluidic channels. The Fe3S4-Pt nanoclusters within the electrocatalytic fibers were able to catalyze the generation of NO from the sodium nitrite solutions delivered via the same devices. We have applied these fibers to locally generate NO and control NO-mediated neural signaling in vitro and in vivo, paving way for studies of the role of this gaseous messenger in synaptic plasticity and metabolism (&lt;a href="../../publication/park-2020-in-situ/">Nat. Nanotechnol. 2020&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meet the Team</title><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/people_sub/people/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/people_sub/people/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Area III: Contributions of peripheral organ signaling to brain function and behavior</title><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/research/3.fiber-based-devices/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/research/3.fiber-based-devices/</guid><description>&lt;p>Neurological (e.g. Parkinson’s) and psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, social deficits) are often accompanied with comorbidities in the peripheral organ function suggesting a link between the neuronal and endocrine signaling in the periphery and brain dynamics and behavior. We apply our magnetic approaches and multifunctional devices to uncover the enigmatic brain-body circuits that underly the peripheral influences on high-level functions such as reward, affect, or decision making. For instance, using our microelectronic fibers deployed in the duodenum, we found that optically stimulating vagal afferents in the gut is sufficient to impart a reward phenotype (&lt;a href="../../publication/shahriari-2023-multifunctional/">Nat. Biotech.&lt;/a>) previously attributed to dopamine neuron signaling in the brain. Our current projects leverage the neurotechnologies developed in our group in fundamental studies of organ-brain interoception under physiological conditions and in models of Parkinson’s disease, Autism, and affective disorders.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fiber-based Devices</title><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/old_research/3.fiber-based-devices/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/old_research/3.fiber-based-devices/</guid><description>&lt;p>In addition to neural interrogation, we are interested in using fiber-based all-polymer devices as scaffolds for neural tissue engineering and as potential replacements to the injured organs. The versatility of the fiber drawing process allows us to investigate the surface polarity and topographic structure of polymer-based nerve guidance channels on the axonal growth. Furthermore, we can design the fiber-based scaffolds to incorporate neural recording and optical neuromodulation capabilities. The latter may enable us to investigate the role of neural excitation on the axonal growth within the topographically controlled environment. We have recently found that optical neural excitation increases axonal growth by 3-4 fold, and furthermore exerts a directional bias on the growth of unstimulated tissues (&lt;a href="../../publication/park-2015-optogenetic/">Sci. Rep. 2015&lt;/a>). By combining this finding with the ability to optimize the scaffold geometry (&lt;a href="../../publication/koppes-2016-thermally/">Biomaterials 2016&lt;/a>) and nutrient transport (&lt;a href="../../publication/shahriari-2019-scalable/">Adv. Mater. 2019&lt;/a>) we intend to control the formation of synaptic connections between the neurons trapped within our scaffolds and the neurons within the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nerves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the goal of developing seamless interfaces between the prosthetic limbs and the injured nerves, we applied fiber fabrication to create light-weight fiber-based artificial muscles (&lt;a href="../../publication/kanik-2019-strain/">Science 2019&lt;/a>). These devices mimicking the structure of cucumber tendrils, are composed of bimorphs of an elastomer and a high-performance plastic with drastically different coefficients of thermal expansion that have been subjected to strains in excess of 700% to impart helical geometry. Upon an exposure to a moderate temperature increase (~10°C), these devices can respond with sub-second latencies lifting &amp;gt;600 times their weight.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New postdoc - Welcome Jacob!</title><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/post/2023-09-04-welcome-jacob/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/post/2023-09-04-welcome-jacob/</guid><description>&lt;p>We welcome Jacob Beckham to the Bioelectronics group!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New technician - Welcome Lee!</title><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/post/2023-08-21_welcome-lee/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/post/2023-08-21_welcome-lee/</guid><description>&lt;p>We welcome Lee Maresco to the Bioelectronics group!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New postdoc - Welcome Taylor!</title><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/post/2023-07-17-welcome-taylor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/post/2023-07-17-welcome-taylor/</guid><description>&lt;p>We welcome Taylor Cannon to the Bioelectronics group!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Magnetic robots walk, crawl, and swim</title><link>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/post/2023-magnetic-robot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bioelectronics.mit.edu/post/2023-magnetic-robot/</guid><description>&lt;p>MIT scientists have developed tiny, soft-bodied robots that can be controlled with a weak magnet. The robots, formed from rubbery magnetic spirals, can be programmed to walk, crawl, swim — all in response to a simple, easy-to-apply magnetic field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“This is the first time this has been done, to be able to control three-dimensional locomotion of robots with a one-dimensional magnetic field,” says Professor Polina Anikeeva, whose team published an open-access paper on the magnetic robots June 3 in the journal Advanced Materials. “And because they are predominantly composed of polymer and polymers are soft, you don’t need a very large magnetic field to activate them. It’s actually a really tiny magnetic field that drives these robots,” adds Anikeeva, who is a professor of materials science and engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at MIT, a McGovern Institute for Brain Research associate investigator, as well as the associate director of MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics and director of MIT’s &lt;a href="https://yangtan.mit.edu/k-lisa-yang-brain-body-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K. Lisa Yang Brain-Body Center&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new robots are well suited to transport cargo through confined spaces and their rubber bodies are gentle on fragile environments, opening the possibility that the technology could be developed for biomedical applications. Anikeeva and her team have made their robots millimeters long, but she says the same approach could be used to produce much smaller robots.&lt;/p>

This extensive communication network also influences our mental state and has been implicated in many neurological disorders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MIT engineers have designed a new technology for probing those connections. Using fibers embedded with a variety of sensors, as well as light sources for optogenetic stimulation, the researchers have shown that they can control neural circuits connecting the gut and the brain, in mice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a new study, the researchers demonstrated that they could induce feelings of fullness or reward-seeking behavior in mice by manipulating cells of the intestine. In future work, they hope to explore some of the correlations that have been observed between digestive health and neurological conditions such as autism and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“The exciting thing here is that we now have technology that can drive gut function and behaviors such as feeding. More importantly, we have the ability to start accessing the crosstalk between the gut and the brain with the millisecond precision of optogenetics, and we can do it in behaving animals,” says Polina Anikeeva, the Matoula S. Salapatas Professor in Materials Science and Engineering, a professor of brain and cognitive sciences, director of the K. Lisa Yang Brain-Body Center, associate director of MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics, and a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research.&lt;/p>

But exactly how the two interact is less clear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A new research center at MIT, funded by a $38 million gift to the McGovern Institute for Brain Research from philanthropist K.

This gift expands Yang’s exceptional philanthropic support of human health and basic science research at MIT over the past five years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Lisa Yang’s visionary gift enables MIT scientists and engineers to pioneer revolutionary technologies and undertake rigorous investigations into the brain&amp;rsquo;s complex relationship with other organ systems,” says MIT President L. Rafael Reif. “Lisa’s tremendous generosity empowers MIT scientists to make pivotal breakthroughs in brain and biomedical research and, collectively, improve human health on a grand scale.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now professor of materials science and engineering and brain and cognitive sciences at MIT, Anikeeva had recently worked on optoelectronics, devices that can detect and control light, and her work was used to illuminate the quantum-dot displays on Samsung TVs. But Anikeeva’s research interests started to stray into biology and neuroscience, disciplines outside her immediate orbit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I wanted to apply my knowledge as a materials scientist and engineer to problems that were unsolved, to devices that didn’t exist,” said Anikeeva on April 22, while delivering the Department of Materials Science and Engineering’s twice-yearly Wulff Lecture.&lt;/p>

But these responses have been more difficult for researchers to study, because there has been no easily controllable method for inducing such mechanical stimulation of the cells. Now, researchers at MIT and elsewhere have found a new method for doing just that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The finding might offer a step toward new kinds of therapeutic treatments, similar to electrically based neurostimulation that has been used to treat Parkinson’s disease and other conditions. Unlike those systems, which require an external wire connection, the new system would be completely contact-free after an initial injection of particles, and could be reactivated at will through an externally applied magnetic field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The finding is reported in the journal ACS Nano, in a paper by former MIT postdoc Danijela Gregurec, Alexander Senko PhD ’19, Associate Professor Polina Anikeeva, and nine others at MIT, at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and in Spain.&lt;/p>

It also functions as a messenger in the cardiovascular and immune systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it has been difficult for researchers to study exactly what its role is in these systems and how it functions. Because it is a gas, there has been no practical way to direct it to specific individual cells in order to observe its effects. Now, a team of scientists and engineers at MIT and elsewhere has found a way of generating the gas at precisely targeted locations inside the body, potentially opening new lines of research on this essential molecule’s effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The findings are reported today in the journal Nature Nanotechnology, in a paper by MIT professors Polina Anikeeva, Karthish Manthiram, and Yoel Fink; graduate student Jimin Park; postdoc Kyoungsuk Jin; and 10 others at MIT and in Taiwan, Japan, and Israel.&lt;/p>

MIT researchers, including the Anikeeva group, have now devised a way to remotely control the release of these hormones from the adrenal gland using magnetic nanoparticles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To achieve control over hormone release, Dekel Rosenfeld, an MIT-Technion postdoc in Professor Anikeeva’s group, has developed specialized magnetic nanoparticles that can be injected into the adrenal gland. When exposed to a weak magnetic field, the particles heat up slightly, activating heat-responsive channels that trigger hormone release. This technique can be used to stimulate an organ deep in the body with minimal invasiveness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The researchers now plan to use this approach to study how hormone release affects PTSD and other disorders, and they say that eventually it could be adapted for treating such disorders. This method would offer a much less invasive alternative to potential treatments that involve implanting a medical device to electrically stimulate hormone release, which is not feasible in organs such as the adrenal glands that are soft and highly vascularized.&lt;/p>

Inspired by cucumber plants, which use their tightly-coiled tendrils to pull the plants upwards, this system utilizes a heat-activated coiling-and-pulling mechanism. Two materials that have different rates of thermal expansion are joined, causing the resulting fiber to form a tight coil with a surprisingly strong pulling force when even a small increase in temperature is applied. This process of contracting and expanding was shown in testing to maintain its strength even after repeating 10,000 times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These fibers can span a wide range of sizes, and can easily be manufactured in batches up to hundreds of meters long. They are extremely lightweight and can respond quickly. Such fibers could be useful as actuators in robotic arms, legs, or grippers, as well as in prosthetic limbs, although postdoc Mehmet Kanik says that the possibilities for materials of this type are virtually limitless.&lt;/p>
