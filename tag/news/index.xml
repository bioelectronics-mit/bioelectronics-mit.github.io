Salapatas Professor at MIT, has been named the new head of MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering (DMSE), effective July 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Professor Anikeeva’s passion and dedication as both a researcher and educator, as well as her impressive network of connections across the wider Institute, make her incredibly well suited to lead DMSE,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, chief innovation and strategy officer, dean of engineering, and Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to serving as a professor in DMSE, Anikeeva is a professor of brain and cognitive sciences, director of the K. Lisa Yang Brain-Body Center, a member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and associate director of MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anikeeva leads the MIT Bioelectronics Group, which focuses on developing magnetic and optoelectronic tools to study neural communication in health and disease. Her team applies magnetic nanomaterials and fiber-based devices to reveal physiological processes underlying brain-organ communication, with particular focus on gut-brain circuits. Their goal is to develop minimally invasive treatments for a range of neurological, psychiatric, and metabolic conditions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anikeeva’s research sits at the intersection of materials chemistry, electronics, and neurobiology. By bridging these disciplines, Anikeeva and her team are deepening our understanding and treatment of complex neurological disorders. Her approach has led to the creation of optoelectronic and magnetic devices that can record neural activity and stimulate neurons during behavioral studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout her career, Anikeeva has been recognized with numerous awards for her groundbreaking research. Her honors include receiving an NSF CAREER Award, DARPA Young Faculty Award, and the Pioneer Award from the NIH’s High-Risk, High-Reward Research Program. MIT Technology Review named her one of the 35 Innovators Under 35 and the Vilcek Foundation awarded her the Prize for Creative Promise in Biomedical Science.&lt;/p>
